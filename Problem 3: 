First Step :
  - Check which proses eating this resource i will use `ps aux --sort=-%cpu | head -10` or top or htop
  - If It's confirm from NGINX services, then tail the log to check unusually process using `tail -f`
    - Possible issues:
      - High traffic (DDoS or legitimate)
      - Misconfigured proxy_pass or infinite loops
      - Too many worker processes consuming CPU

  - If we find unusually activity, let's say this is repeating IP address hit, then block the IP `sudo iptables -A INPUT -s {IP address} -j DROP`
  - If There is no unusually activity try to adjust NGINX configuration
  Adjust these settings:
    - Reduce worker_processes (set to the number of CPU cores)
    - Optimize worker_connections (e.g., 1024 or 2048)
    - Enable caching if applicable

  - Another we can do is setup rate limit in nginx.
  - If all this case didnt works, try to dig more in logs to find anomally URL and communicate it with developer.
