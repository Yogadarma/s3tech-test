- Load Balancing & Failover (load balancer have job to make the load dyanically spread)
    - Global Load Balancers (AWS ALB, Cloudflare, HAProxy)
    - Multiple Data Centers (Active-Active/Passive mode)

- Database Scalability
    - Setup Read Replicas for high read throughput in database cluster, separating read and write data is a must for this apps.
    - Activating for horizontal scaling, would be good if we can activated this features the the apps already optimized when processing the data.

- Caching Strategy
    - We can use Redis for API response caching, also this will make the resource is not to high
    - CDN (Cloudflare, Akamai) for static assets, align with respon time this will give the good time response

- Asynchronous Processing
    - Message Queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ) for order execution

- Disaster Recovery
    - Multi-region deployments (multi A-Z in AWS)
    - Automated Backups with versioning
    - Failover strategies using cloud-native tools

- Monitoring
    - Prometheus, Grafana for real-time monitoring
    - ELK stack for logs.

- API Security
    - Rate limiting (Cloudflare/NGINX)
    - Web Application Firewall (WAF)

- User Security
    - Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
    - Device Fingerprinting

- Data Security
    - End-to-End Encryption
    - HSM for Private Key Storage (AWS KMS, Google Cloud KMS)

- Deployment Strategy
    - Kubernetes (K8s) for container orchestration
    - CI/CD Pipelines with GitHub Actions / Jenkins
    - Auto-scaling groups for handling traffic spikes (vertical or horizontal)
